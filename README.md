**Simplify IIoT development using the elasticity of Public Cloud and Native Cloud Services**

## What is this book about?
<span class="sugar_field" id="description">The Industrial Internet refers to the integration of complex physical machines with networked sensors and software. The current growth in the number of sensors deployed in heavy machinery and industrial equipment will lead to an exponential increase in data being captured that needs to be analyzed for predictive analytics. This also opens up a new avenue for developers who want to build exciting industrial applications. </span>

This book covers the following exciting features:
Connect prototype devices to CloudStore data in IIoT applications 
Explore data management techniques and implementation 
Study IIoT applications analytics using Spark ML and TensorFlow 
Deploy analytics and visualize the outcomes as Alerts 
Understand continuous deployment using Docker and Cloud Foundry 
Make your applications fault-tolerant and monitor them with New Relic 
Understand IIoT platform architecture and implement IIoT applications on the platform
